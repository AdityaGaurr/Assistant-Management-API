# Assistant Management API

This is a backend application that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for managing assistants. The application is built using Python, Flask, and SQLite.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/assistant-management-api.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd assistant-management-api
```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```
python -m venv env
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```
env\Scripts\activate
```

- On Unix/Linux/macOS:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

1. With the virtual environment activated, run the Flask application:

```
python app.py
```

2. The application should start running, and you should see output similar to the following:

```
* Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
  WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
  Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Debug mode: on
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
* Restarting with stat
* Debugger is active!
* Debugger PIN: 123-456-789
```

3. The API endpoints are now accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /assistant`: Create a new assistant
- `GET /assistant/<assistant_id>`: Retrieve details of an assistant
- `PUT /assistant/<assistant_id>`: Update details of an assistant
- `DELETE /assistant/<assistant_id>`: Delete an assistant

## Testing with Postman

1. Import the Postman collection `assistant-api.postman_collection.json` into Postman.
2. Use the imported collection to test the API endpoints.

## Database

The application uses an SQLite database named `assistants.db` to store assistant data. The database file will be created automatically in the project directory when you run the application for the first time.

## Dependencies

The required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and will be installed automatically when you run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The main dependencies are:

- Flask: A lightweight Python web framework
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: An extension for Flask that provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer for working with databases
